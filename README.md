These are my dotfiles! Check out this site to understand what that means: https://dotfiles.github.io/

Currently a WIP, still experimenting.

## Installation

So you like my dotfiles, eh?

First off, I'm trying out [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/) as my dotfiles management tool.

You can currently install them by following these instructions:

1. [Install chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/install/)

	or  
SSH: `chezmoi init git@github.com/aredshift/dotfiles.git`  
1.`chezmoi apply`
